  The development execution protocol (Phase 4). Reads .claude/backlog.md and processes
  stories one at a time with TDD, runs quality gates with retries, and — on a clean gate
  pass — merges each story's feature branch back into the repo's INTEGRATION branch. The
  loop never touches `main`/the default branch (integration→main is a downstream DevOps
  step). It halts honestly on stop conditions, including a repo-ownership boundary and any
  unauthorized irreversible/outward action. Fully resumable. NOT invoked by a human
  directly — invoked by a runtime adapter launcher or explicit runtime prompt. Assumes
  architect review is complete; it reads the backlog as-is.

# Skill: autonomous-loop

## 1. Purpose

This is the autonomous development loop. Given a reviewed backlog, it implements stories one
at a time — each on its own feature branch cut from the repo's **integration branch**,
test-first, behind quality gates — and on a clean gate pass merges the feature branch **back
into the integration branch**. It continues until the backlog is empty or a stop condition
fires. It is resumable across context resets because all state lives in plain files.

**The Git model is integration branch + feature-branch-per-story (spec §11.2, §14.9).** Each
repo has one integration branch, created off `main` (the default branch) the first time the
repo is touched. The loop **never touches `main`** — merging integration→`main` is a separate,
explicitly-gated **promotion phase** (spec §11.6, skill `promotion` / `/promote`), out of the
loop's scope. That phase has two modes: `external` (a downstream actor/DevOps merges, typically
after a production deploy) and `pravartak-gated` (Pravartak runs a human- and CI-gated
promotion). **In neither mode does the unattended per-story loop merge to `main`.** The
per-story merge into the integration branch on a passing gate **is** the autonomous merge
approval only when no separate story-review gate is configured. In mixed-runtime mode
(`implementation_runtime` differs from `review_runtime`) or when
`review_before_completion: required`, the story is not eligible to merge into `integration`
until the configured review runtime has approved the implementation and that review is
captured durably. The loop does not ask a human per merge unless the project selects
`pr-based`; it never opens a PR to `main`.

**Honest halt over forced completion (spec §14.10).** A real backlog to a 95%-coverage /
integration-test bar is multi-session work; one run will not honestly finish a large backlog.
The loop reports partial/HALTED with true per-story status rather than fabricate a passing
gate or report COMPLETE for unbuilt work. Escalation and honest partial reporting are
expected, first-class outcomes — a HALTED report covering three real, tested stories is a
success, not a shortfall.

## 2. Invocation

Autonomous execution is launched explicitly by an operator, never by a `/`-command and never
by this skill itself.

Canonical inputs for every runtime:

- `PRAVARTAK.md`
- the assigned runtime's adapter guide
- this file

Claude's verified launcher is documented in `docs/agent-runtimes/claude.md`. Codex uses the
explicit prompt documented in `docs/agent-runtimes/codex.md`.

On launch:

1. Read `PRAVARTAK.md` for the project's standards, protocol, runtime assignments, and
   configuration (§3).
2. Read the assigned runtime's adapter guide (`docs/agent-runtimes/claude.md` or
   `docs/agent-runtimes/codex.md`).
3. Read this file (`pravartak/skills/autonomous-loop/SKILL.md`) for the execution procedure.
4. Read the standards under `pravartak/standards/` that the project's stories touch.
5. Run the repo-ownership pre-check (§6.0) and the resume check (§5.2).
6. Run the consolidated autonomous preflight, then the no-delete guard and daily budget
   preflight (§5.1), then start at the first
   unchecked story in `.claude/backlog.md` whose dependencies are complete.
7. Continue until the backlog is empty or a stop condition fires (§7).

**Precondition — review is complete.** This loop reads `.claude/backlog.md` as-is and assumes
architect review (Phase 3) finished. It does not review, does not edit specs, and does not
propagate intent — that is architect-review territory. If the project skipped review, the loop
still runs, but the result may not match architect intent (spec §14.8).

## 3. Configuration (read from `PRAVARTAK.md`, in prose)

`PRAVARTAK.md` is plain prose. Honor these knobs if present; otherwise use the defaults:

| Knob | Default | Effect |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `autonomous_runtime` | `claude` | Runtime assigned to run this loop. |
| `implementation_runtime` | `claude` | Runtime expected to implement stories during this phase. |
| `review_runtime` | `claude` | Runtime expected to perform story review and promotion gates. |
| `integration_branch` | `integration` | The repo's integration branch. The loop cuts feature branches from it and merges back into it. Created off the default branch on first touch. |
| `git_workflow` | `auto-merge` | `auto-merge`: on a clean gate pass, merge feature → integration branch directly (gate-pass IS the approval). `pr-based`: open a PR via `gh pr create` targeting the **integration branch** (human reviews the merge). `local-only`: no remote operations. **No mode ever targets `main`.** |
| `coverage_threshold` | `95` | Coverage percentage the gate enforces. |
| `gate_strictness` | `strict` | `strict`: block on any warning. `lenient`: allow warnings, block on errors. |
| `review_before_completion` | `required when implementation_runtime != review_runtime` | Require a durable story review before `.claude/backlog.md`, `.claude/completed.md`, or `.pravartak/session-state.json` mark the story complete. Set `off` only for same-runtime projects that intentionally treat gate-pass as the only review. |
| `sprint_cadence` | by story batch | `weekly` (or other): produce sprint tags on that cadence regardless of story count. |
| `branch_pattern` | `feature/<project>-<story-id>-<slug>` | Feature-branch naming. |
| `max_stories_per_day` | `10` | Maximum completed stories per UTC day. The persisted `.pravartak/session-state.json` value is authoritative for the current day, and `MAX_STORIES_PER_DAY` overrides it for one launch. |
| `tracker_sync` | `off` | `on`: for issue-tracker archetypes (`jira`/`linear`), update the corresponding tracker issue to its done state when a story completes (§6.8), via the archetype's `connector.md`. Opt-in; the project's own tracker only. |
| `tracker_done_state` | archetype default | The target tracker status/state for write-back (e.g. `Done`) when not the tracker's default completed state. |

Determine the default branch once at startup (the branch the integration branch is cut from,
e.g. `main`). Determine remote mode once: if `git_workflow: local-only` is set, or the repo
has no `origin` remote (`git remote get-url origin` fails), operate in **local-only mode**
(§6.5) — never attempt a push or any remote operation.

If `git_workflow: pr-based` is selected, preflight the GitHub CLI repo access before selecting
work. The Codex helper exposes `scripts/codex-auto.sh --check-pr-access`; a failure is
`GH_PR_ACCESS_REQUIRED` and must halt before implementation, not after a story is built.

## 4. State files

| File | Role |
| --- | --- |
| `.claude/backlog.md` | The stories. Unchecked `[ ]` = not done; checked `[x]` = done. Source of work order. |
| `.claude/current_story.md` | The story currently in progress (for resume). |
| `.claude/completed.md` | Append-only log of completed stories. |
| `.claude/blocked.md` | Stories that could not proceed (with reason). |
| `.claude/escalations.md` | Stop-condition context written on halt (§7). |
| `.claude/commit_log.txt` | Running log of commits made by the loop. |
| `.pravartak/session-state.json` | Daily autonomous session budget: `date`, `completedToday`, `maxStoriesPerDay`, `lastStartedStory`, `lastCompletedStory`. |
| `docs/sprint-reports/sprint-<n>.md` | Per-sprint summaries (§8). |

## 5. Pre-story Checks And Resume

### 5.1 No-delete and daily-budget preflight (before selecting work)

Before picking any next story, run the executable guards generated into the project:

1. Run `scripts/autonomous-preflight.sh` before starting an unattended batch. If it reports
   `PREFLIGHT_BLOCKED`, use `.pravartak/preflight-report.md` as the consolidated blocker
   report and halt before implementation.
2. Run `scripts/no-delete-guard.sh --check-diff`. If it reports a delete or rename status,
   halt with `BLOCKED_DELETION_REQUIRED` and write the diff status to
   `.claude/escalations.md`. Do not continue by deleting, renaming, or cleaning up files.
3. Read `.pravartak/session-state.json`. If `MAX_STORIES_PER_DAY` is set, update
   `maxStoriesPerDay` for this run. Otherwise use the persisted `maxStoriesPerDay`, default
   `10` if absent.
4. Compare `date` to today's UTC date (`YYYY-MM-DD`). If the date changed, set `date` to
   today and reset `completedToday` to `0`; preserve `maxStoriesPerDay` and the story
   pointers.
5. If `completedToday >= maxStoriesPerDay`, exit cleanly with `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED`. This is a
   successful bounded-session stop, not an error.
6. After selecting a story, record it as `lastStartedStory` before implementation begins.

The generated `scripts/codex-auto.sh --check-budget` and `--mark-started <STORY-ID>` commands
implement this state transition for Codex launches. Other runtimes must perform the same
state transition if they do not use the helper.

### 5.2 Resume check (run first, every launch)

Before starting any new story:

1. Read `.claude/escalations.md`. If it contains an **unresolved** escalation, stop and report
   it — do not blindly resume past a halt the architect hasn't cleared.
2. Read `.claude/current_story.md`. If a story is mid-flight (feature branch exists, partial
   work), resume **that** story from where it stopped rather than starting a new one. Inspect
   the working tree and the feature branch to determine progress.
3. Read `.claude/blocked.md` so you don't re-attempt a story known to be blocked unless its
   blocker is resolved.
4. Otherwise, run §5.1, then select the first unchecked story in `.claude/backlog.md` whose
   dependencies are all complete.

Never double-process a story already checked `[x]` in the backlog or present in `completed.md`.

## 6. Per-story loop

### 6.0 Repo-ownership pre-check (before any branch/commit/push — spec §14.11)

Autonomous execution is safe **only in a repository the session owns a real working checkout
of.** Before the loop writes to, branches on, or pushes to *any* repository — the project repo
or any repo a story references — confirm ownership of that exact repo:

1. **It is a real, full working checkout you control.** Reject shallow/analysis clones:
   `git -C <repo> rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` returning `true` → **not owned**. A repo
   present only for read-only analysis is not a build target.
2. **It is the project's own repo** (the checkout auto-mode was launched in — `CLAUDE_PROJECT_DIR`
   / the cwd git root), not a sibling directory or another team's repository.
3. **You are authorized to push to it for this run.** The project repo is authorized by
   construction; any *other* repo is not, absent explicit authorization in `PRAVARTAK.md` or
   the run instructions.

If a story requires writing to / branching on / pushing to / opening a PR against a repo that
fails any check → **halt and escalate** (§7), naming exactly which repo and which action, for
the assigned review runtime or a human to perform in a proper checkout with the owning team
aware. **Reading** another repo's code for context is fine; **writing** to it is not. The clean
rule (spec §14.11): the autonomous/developer boundary IS the repo-ownership boundary — the
loop builds what you own; anything touching other teams' repos is human-driven developer work.

### 6.1 Begin

1. Confirm the story's dependencies are complete (check `completed.md`). If a dependency is
   incomplete, escalate (`story depends on incomplete prior work`, §7).
2. Confirm acceptance criteria are inferable from the spec. If not, escalate
   (`acceptance criteria cannot be inferred`, §7).
3. Record the story in `.claude/current_story.md`.
4. Record the story id in `.pravartak/session-state.json` as `lastStartedStory` (or run
   `scripts/codex-auto.sh --mark-started <STORY-ID>`).
5. **Ensure the integration branch exists.** If `integration_branch` does not exist yet,
   create it off the default branch on this first touch
   (`git checkout <default-branch> && git checkout -b <integration_branch>`), and push it in
   remote modes. Otherwise check it out and fast-forward it to its remote tip.
6. **Cut the feature branch from the integration branch** (not from the default branch), using
   `branch_pattern`: `git checkout -b feature/<project>-<story-id>-<slug> <integration_branch>`.

### 6.2 Implement with TDD

Follow `pravartak/standards/TDD_AND_COVERAGE.md`:

1. Write a failing test for the next acceptance criterion.
2. Implement the minimum to make it pass.
3. Refactor with tests green.
4. Repeat until all acceptance criteria are covered, including the test classes the standards
   require (unit, integration against real backing services for integration points, contract,
   error-path) and the cross-cutting standards (async-first, persistence hardening,
   observability, security baseline).

Every file the loop creates gets the project's inline provenance header where the file type
supports comments (the loop generates project source; see the scaffold's manifest for the
header format).

Line-level edits inside existing files are allowed. File deletions and renames are not. If an
acceptance criterion appears to require deleting, moving, or renaming a file, stop immediately
and report `BLOCKED_DELETION_REQUIRED`; do not attempt an equivalent cleanup.

### 6.3 Quality gates (local)

Run `.claude/scripts/gate.sh`. Honor `gate_strictness` and `coverage_threshold`. The gate runs,
in order: lint, format check, type check, unit tests, integration tests, coverage threshold.
**Retry a failing gate up to 3 times**, fixing the cause between attempts. Three consecutive
failures on the **same** gate → escalate (§7).

Note the gate already tolerates `pytest` exit code 5 (no tests collected) as success for empty
stages (spec §14.2); do not treat that as a failure.

### 6.4 Commit

Commit the work (one commit per story, story-id-prefixed message). The `PreToolUse` hook in
`.claude/settings.json` re-runs the gate as a final check at commit time (hooks live under the
`"hooks"` key — spec §14.4). If the hook blocks, treat it as a gate failure and return to §6.3.
Append the commit to `.claude/commit_log.txt`.

Before committing, run `scripts/no-delete-guard.sh --check-diff`. The commit is blocked if
`git diff` contains `D` or `R` status entries. Renames are unsupported in autonomous mode
because they are delete/add operations from the safety model's perspective.

### 6.5 Push and review the feature branch

After a clean local gate, push the feature branch in remote modes:

1. Push the feature branch: `git push -u origin <feature-branch>` (preserves history). Skip
   this in local-only mode.
2. Run the required review gate (§6.6) before any auto-merge into `integration`. If review is
   unavailable, unapproved, or returns findings, halt or fix on the feature branch. Do not merge
   unreviewed mixed-runtime work to `integration`.

For `pr-based`, the PR can be opened before or after review depending on project preference,
but `gh` access must have been preflighted before implementation. If PR creation still fails
after preflight, halt honestly; do not mark complete or advance the daily counter.

### 6.6 Review gate

Run this section after the implementation commit and feature-branch push, but before
auto-merging to `integration` or marking the story complete.

Review is required when `review_before_completion: required`, or when
`implementation_runtime` and `review_runtime` differ. When review is required:

1. Ask the configured `review_runtime` to review the story diff or PR. The review must focus
   on correctness, acceptance criteria, missing tests, regression risk, security risk, and
   whether the story is safe to mark complete.
   If `review_runtime` is Claude and `scripts/claude-review.sh` exists, use
   `scripts/claude-review.sh <STORY-ID> <integration_branch>` rather than invoking Claude
   directly. The wrapper gives Claude a diff-only prompt, disables tools, and enforces a
   timeout so reviewer unavailability becomes a durable halt instead of an unbounded wait.
2. Capture the full review in `.claude/reviews/<STORY-ID>.md` with findings first and a
   clear final line: `Verdict: APPROVED`, `Verdict: NEEDS_CHANGES`, or `Verdict: REJECTED`.
   `Recommendation: APPROVED/PASS` is accepted for compatibility with existing reviewer
   agents.
   `Verdict: REVIEW_UNAVAILABLE` means the review runtime did not return a usable result; halt
   with that durable file and do not merge or advance the daily counter.
3. If the review verdict is `NEEDS_CHANGES` or `REJECTED`, fix the findings on the feature
   branch, rerun the local gate, recommit, push/update the PR, and rerun review. Do not
   integrate or mark the story complete while an unapproved review record is the latest durable
   review.
4. Only an approved durable review satisfies this gate. A transient terminal response that is
   not written to `.claude/reviews/<STORY-ID>.md` is not enough.
5. For Codex launches, `scripts/codex-auto.sh --record-completed <STORY-ID>` enforces this
   guard when the project configuration requires review. If it reports `REVIEW_REQUIRED` or
   `REVIEW_NOT_APPROVED`, halt honestly and fix/review rather than bypassing the guard.

When review is not required, the clean gate is enough to proceed to integration.

### 6.7 Integrate — merge into the integration branch (never `main`)

Integration happens only on a **clean gate pass** and any required approved review. Behavior
depends on `git_workflow` (§3):

**auto-merge (default, remote present):**

1. Check out the integration branch and merge the reviewed feature branch into it with no
   fast-forward:
   `git checkout <integration_branch> && git merge --no-ff <feature-branch>` with a merge-commit
   message referencing the story id. **Gate-pass plus required review is the approval — do not
   ask a human per merge.**
2. **Re-run the no-delete guard and the gate against the integration branch post-merge.** If
   either fails, do not push the integration branch. Halt and escalate with the pre-merge
   commit, merge commit, guard/gate output, and repair instructions for a human. Do not use
   `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`, `git restore`, or any deletion-based cleanup.
3. Push the integration branch: `git push origin <integration_branch>`.
4. **Do not delete the feature branch** and **do not touch `main`** (spec §14.7, §14.9).
   Feature branches are kept until their work reaches `main` via the downstream
   integration→`main` merge; pruning is a periodic hygiene step outside this loop.

**pr-based (`git_workflow: pr-based`):**

1. Open a PR **targeting the integration branch** (`gh pr create --base <integration_branch>`)
   with a title/body summarizing the story. Do **not** merge — human review owns the merge.
   If PR creation fails, halt and escalate; do not mark the story complete and do not advance
   the daily story counter. (Never target `main`.)

**local-only (`git_workflow: local-only` or no origin):**

1. Do not push.
2. Check out the integration branch and merge the feature branch into it locally with `--no-ff`.
3. Re-run the no-delete guard and the gate against the integration branch; on failure, halt
   and escalate with the true local state. Do not undo with destructive commands.
4. Do not delete the feature branch; no remote operations.

### 6.8 Finish the story

A story is finished **only if it genuinely passed the full gate, completed the configured
integration/PR step, and passed any required review gate** (§1, honest completion). Then:

1. Mark the story `[x]` in `.claude/backlog.md`.
2. Append the story to `.claude/completed.md` (id, title, feature branch, merge-commit/PR
   reference, timestamp).
3. Update `.pravartak/session-state.json` only after the story commit, required review gate,
   configured integration step, and post-integration gate have succeeded. Increment
   `completedToday` by one and set `lastCompletedStory` to the story id. Never increment after
   a failed commit, failed push, failed PR creation, failed local integration,
   missing/unapproved review, blocked story, or partial implementation.
4. **Tracker write-back (opt-in).** If `tracker_sync: on` and the project uses an issue-tracker
   archetype (`jira`/`linear`), update the corresponding tracker issue to its done state via
   the archetype's `connector.md` write-back (resolve the issue from the story's `[KEY]`
   identifier). This is an outward action on the **project's own tracker**, authorized solely
   by the `tracker_sync` opt-in — never another team's tracker, and never enabled implicitly
   (consistent with §7's irreversible/outward-action stop condition). If the write-back fails
   (auth/permission/unknown state), escalate rather than reporting the tracker as synced. When
   `tracker_sync: off`, skip this step entirely.
5. Clear `.claude/current_story.md`.
6. Proceed to the next story (back to §5's selection, step 4).

If the story could not pass, do **not** mark it complete and do **not** merge partial work —
escalate (§7) or block (§7, soft) with the true state.

## 7. Stop conditions

When any of the following occurs, write context to `.claude/escalations.md` (the story id, what
happened, the relevant gate output or denial, and what the architect should decide) and **halt
the loop**:

- 3 consecutive failures on the same gate after retries.
- 20 total denied operations in the session.
- Acceptance criteria cannot be inferred from the spec.
- A story depends on incomplete prior work.
- A required spec change surfaces mid-implementation. The loop does **not** modify specs; record
  what change is needed and halt (architect-review will handle it, queuing a corrective story if
  needed).
- The auto-mode classifier blocks an action and no safe alternative exists.
- **File deletion or rename required.** A story requires deleting, moving, or renaming a file,
  or the working tree contains `D`/`R` git diff status entries. Halt with
  `BLOCKED_DELETION_REQUIRED`; do not proceed with an equivalent cleanup.
- Daily budget exhausted: `completedToday >= maxStoriesPerDay`. Exit cleanly with
  `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` before selecting another story.
- **Repo-ownership boundary (spec §14.11).** A story requires writing to, branching on, or
  pushing to a repository the session does not own a real working checkout of (a
  read-only/shallow analysis clone, or another team's repo — see §6.0). The loop must NOT push
  branches or open PRs there. Halt and surface exactly which repo and which action, for a human
  to perform in a proper checkout with the owning team aware.
- **Irreversible or outward-facing action without explicit authorization (spec §11.4).** Any
  push/PR to an external repository, any action on another team's live system, or any other
  outward, hard-to-reverse step not explicitly authorized for this run. **Pause and ask rather
  than assuming authorization — even when a literal reading of the instructions seems to permit
  it.** Speed or convenience never licenses an unauthorized outward action.

**Escalation is a first-class, expected outcome, not a failure (spec §14.10).** An honest halt
with true per-story state is always preferred over forcing completion or taking an unauthorized
action.

For a story that is blocked but does not warrant a hard halt (e.g. waiting on an external
dependency), record it in `.claude/blocked.md` with the reason and skip to the next eligible
story rather than halting the whole loop.

## 8. Sprint boundaries

After the last story of a sprint (by story batch, or by `sprint_cadence` if set):

1. Tag the commit on the integration branch: `git tag sprint-<n>-complete`.
2. Push the tag (skip in local-only mode).
3. Write a sprint summary to `docs/sprint-reports/sprint-<n>.md`: stories completed, notable
   decisions, escalations encountered and how they resolved, metrics.
4. Proceed to the next sprint's first story.

## 9. Resumability

The loop is fully resumable: all state is in plain files (§4). Restarting the loop runs the
repo-ownership pre-check (§6.0) and the resume check (§5) and continues from wherever it
stopped — mid-story if `current_story.md` points at an in-flight story, or at the next unchecked
backlog story otherwise. Never double-process a story already checked `[x]` in the backlog or
present in `completed.md`.

## 10. Guardrails

- **Never touch `main`/the default branch.** The loop merges into the integration branch only;
  integration→`main` happens only in the separate, explicitly-gated promotion phase (§12; spec
  §11.6) — never the unattended loop, in either promotion mode.
- **Build only what you own.** Honor the repo-ownership boundary (§6.0); never push, branch, or
  open a PR against a repo the session does not own a real working checkout of.
- **Never take an unauthorized outward/irreversible action.** Pause and ask; a literal reading
  of instructions does not grant authorization (spec §11.4).
- **Never delete or rename files in autonomous mode.** Block `D` and `R` git diff statuses.
  Do not run `rm`, `rmdir`, `unlink`, `git clean`, `git reset --hard`, `git checkout --`,
  `git restore`, destructive `mv`, or equivalent cleanup. If a deletion is genuinely
  required, halt with `BLOCKED_DELETION_REQUIRED`.
- **Honest completion only.** Mark a story complete only if it genuinely passed the full gate;
  never fabricate a passing gate or report COMPLETE for unbuilt/untested work (spec §14.10).
- **Never push a broken integration branch.** Always re-run the no-delete guard and gate
  post-merge. If either fails, halt before push and report the exact state for attended
  repair.
- **Never count an unreviewed mixed-runtime story as complete.** When
  `implementation_runtime` and `review_runtime` differ, or `review_before_completion` is
  required, `.claude/reviews/<STORY-ID>.md` must contain an approved review before backlog,
  completed-log, or daily-budget state advances.
- **Never edit specs or `discovery/`.** Spec changes are architect-review's job; halt and
  escalate if one is needed.
- **Do not delete feature branches.** Cleanup is a downstream hygiene step after integration→
  `main`, not part of this loop (spec §14.7).
- **Never skip the pre-check or the resume check.** Double-processing a story corrupts state.
- **Respect the budget.** `--max-budget-usd` is a hard ceiling; if approaching it, finish the
  current story cleanly, record state, and stop rather than leaving work half-done.
- **Respect the daily story budget.** `.pravartak/session-state.json` is checked before each
  new story. Stop with `BUDGET_EXHAUSTED` when the daily budget is spent.

## 11. Outputs

- Implemented stories merged into the **integration branch** (or PRs targeting it in pr-based
  mode), test-first and gated, each marked `[x]` in the backlog and logged in `completed.md`.
- Feature branches retained (not deleted) for traceability to the in-flight integration branch.
- Sprint tags and `docs/sprint-reports/sprint-<n>.md` summaries.
- `escalations.md` / `blocked.md` entries where the loop could not proceed — including honest
  HALTED reports with true per-story status, which are expected, first-class outcomes.
- `main`/the default branch is **never** modified by the loop.

## 12. Build completion → the promotion phase

When the loop finishes its assigned backlog / story-group (build complete), it **stops at the
integration branch**. It does **not** promote to `main`. Promotion is a separate, explicitly
invoked phase handled by the `promotion` skill (`/promote`), gated by the `promotion` config:

- `promotion: external` (default) — a downstream actor (DevOps) merges integration→`main`. The
  loop and Pravartak take no action on `main`.
- `promotion: pravartak-gated` — Pravartak opens an integration→`main` PR, runs CI on it (the
  only place CI runs), **pauses for explicit human approval**, and squash-merges only on human
  approval **and** green CI; it halts on red CI (honest-halt). See `promotion/SKILL.md`.

In both modes the **unattended per-story loop never merges to `main`** — promotion is always a
deliberate, attended, gated step run after the loop completes. The loop's job ends at a green
integration branch; `/promote` takes it from there.
